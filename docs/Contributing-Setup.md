   - `feat/` - for new functionality
   - `refactor/` - for restructuring of existing features
   - `fix/` - for bugfixes

1. Run `dotnet format` against the `XperienceCommunity.FieldPermissions` solution

   > use `dotnet: format` VS Code task.

1. Commit changes, with a commit message preferably following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) convention.

1. Once ready, create a PR on GitHub. The PR will need to have all comments resolved and all tests passing before it will be merged.
   - The PR should have a helpful description of the scope of changes being contributed.
   - Include screenshots or video to reflect UX or UI updates
   - Indicate if new settings need to be applied when the changes are merged - locally or in other environments
